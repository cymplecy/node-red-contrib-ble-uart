# node-red-contrib-ble-uart
A [Node-RED](http://nodered.org/) node that uses the Noble to interact with BLE devices that support the UART profile by Nordic Semiconductor

## Prerequisites

* [noble](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/noble), a Node.js BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) central module, by Sandeep Mistry

## Install

```sh
cd $HOME/.node-red
npm install node-red-contrib-ble-uart
```

## Run

```sh
sudo node-red-start
```

Note: you have to run with `sudo`, or you can't access your hardware.

## Example

```json
